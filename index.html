		You're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
Stars they dance though late in the night
Don't you know they dance just for you
There you are above darkened clouds
Smiling at the world from afar
With the stars you wander around
May they follow you wherever you are
Here I am just another boy
Singing songs that others have sung
Trying to find the words to employ
To adore the goddess of love
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I
Can't speak no I
Can't speak at all
I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise
Don't think that you can hide it from me
Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine
Oh I can't breathe no I can't breathe at all
Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh
Could you please be mine oh mine
Here you are I've waited so long
Hoping you would sit down to stay
'Cause with these stars I've been dancing along
Like a fool so you'd look my way
You're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
And here I sing though late in the night
Hope you know I sing just for you
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because

I feel like I've played too many chords
And written too many words
To catch you by surprise
Or say something brand new
Oh baby it's true
I'm running out of songs
Songs I wish I'd written for you
I feel like I've loved too many times
The subject of my rhymes
I wish that we had met at the start of my youth
Oh babe that's the truth
I'm running out of songs
Songs I wish I'd written for you
Songs I wish I'd written for you
Pa pa-ra pa-ra pa-ra pa-pa-ra pa-ra-pa
But if I could write it all again
It'd be something like this
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
And if I could live it all again you're the one that I'd pick
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
I feel like I've lived too many years
Blinded by the fear
That everyone I love will bе taken from me
Oh inevitably
I еven wrote a song
But I digress my love
I'm scared I'd write another one
Another goodbye song
But this time I would write it for you
Don't know what to do
Don't wanna write a song
Another sad song written 'bout you
No I don't no I don't
But if I could write it all again
It'd be something like this
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
And if I could live it all again you're the one that I'd pick
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
Drowned by the singing of the crowd you're the one that I'd miss
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
'Cause yours is the loveliest name to come out of my lips
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
La-la la-la lala la-la la-la-la
I feel like I need to know you more
There's still so much to learnI feel like I've played too many chords
